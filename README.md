# React Weather App

React Weather App is a simple weather app created using Create React App. I used the free OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the data.

The app allows you to check the weather forecast for today, and for the next five days for any city in the world. The app displays information such as weather description, temperature, wind strength, sunrise time, and sunset time.
